Project Description : Pet Runner is an application which has been designed and developed to make your walking and running experience even better with your pet. With this application, you can easily find people who have pets around you and can accompany them with their pet so you and your pet both can have a quality time with the people who share the same interests as you. This application separates the parks which are specifically created for the pets and those created for the public. Most of the people don't know that pet specific parks are those in which you can make your pets exercise by making them run freely without leash and meet others who have pets too. So, our app is targeting specifically that audience. Due to COVID-19, lack of socialisation has been an issue across all world so, this application will help people to interact more with each other and go on adventures with them. This app is not only built for those who have pets. It can also be used by those who love running or walking. The application also has an emergency word feature which can make your experience more safe because if you are in trouble then this feature helps you get out of an emergency situation by just saying your chosen emergency word. By saying this word our application will send an SOS to 000 and your selected emergency contact. This application also shows you the areas of high risk based on the assaults happened in that area. This way you can just avoid going in such areas and save yourself from danger. This way the app provides safe interaction in public spaces with people.

Data Story
Our application has used a variety of data sets based on land usage across both Tasmanian and New South Wales. The data which shows which land has been acquired for what use and which land has more security concerns has been taken from the open data provided by both NSW and TAS. This app will be able to combine the public park data with the dog park area data which has been taken from both the open data made available by New South Wales and Tasmania. This app can be a great tool in the post pandemic world where users can interact and play with their pets along with their friends. Just like humans, animals have also been been suffering lockdowns which has made their mental health worse too because of sitting at the same place for whole day. So, this app can help in improving mental health and help people interact more after pandemic.
